</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract104" style="display:none;">A conformal field theory is characterised by the CFT data, namely the spectrum of scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients. The idea of the conformal bootstrap is to use associativity of the operator algebra together with the symmetries of the theory to constraint the CFT data. For the sector of operators with large spin one can actually use these ideas to obtain analytical results. We will explain how to set up a "large spin perturbation theory", namely a systematic expansion around the large spin sector, leading to analytic results to all orders in inverse powers of the spin. This allows to obtain analytic results for vast families of CFTs, including vector models, weakly coupled gauge theories and the computation of loops for scalar theories in AdS.</abstract></td>

<td><abstract id="abstract113" style="display:none;">Casimir operators of Lie algebras play an important role in both representation theory and physical applications.  The Casimir operators for semisimple Lie algebras are well-known, but for non-semisimple Lie algebras the situation can be more complicated. Although several methods and algorithms have been developed over the years that produce Casimir operators in such cases, many have their computational challenges. In my talk, I will outline some ideas developed in my project that form the heart of a new algorithm to produce Casimir operators. I will demonstrate the algorithm in the context of the family of finite-dimensional conformal Galilei algebras.<br />Joint work with Phillip S Isaac, UQ; Dr. Ian Marquette, UQ.</abstract></td>

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract148" style="display:none;">The reversing symmetry group is considered in the setting of symbolic dynamics. While this group is generally too big to be analysed in detail, there are interesting cases with some form of rigidity where one can determine all symmetries and reversing symmetries explicitly. They include Sturmian shifts as well as classic examples such as the Thue--Morse system with various generalisations or the Rudin--Shapiro system.  We also look at generalisations of the reversing symmetry group to higher-dimensional shift spaces, then called the group of extended symmetries. We develop their basic theory for faithful shift actions, and determine the extended symmetry group of the chair tiling shift, which can be described as a model set, and of Ledrappier's shift, which is an example of algebraic origin.<br />Joint work with John A G Roberts, and Reem Yassawi.</abstract></td>

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract154" style="display:none;">Bukhvostov and Lipatov have shown that weakly interacting instantons and anti-instantons in the O(3) non-linear sigma model in two dimensions are described by an exactly soluble  model containing two coupled Dirac fermions.  We propose an exact formula for the vacuum energy of the model for twisted boundary conditions, expressing it through a special solution of the classical sinh-Gordon equation. The formula perfectly matches predictions of the standard renormalized perturbation theory at weak couplings as well as the conformal perturbation theory at short distances. A complete proof the proposed expression for the vacuum energy is based on a combination of the Bethe ansatz techniques and the classical inverse scattering transform method. The description of the vacuum state of the quantum model in terms of the classical sinh-Gordon equation can be viewed as an instance of a remarkable, albeit unusual correspondence between integrable quantum field theories and integrable classical field theories in two dimensions, which cannot be expected from the standard quantumâclassical correspondence principle.</abstract></td>

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract146" style="display:none;">We model long ring polymers in a thin channel, using self-avoiding polygons in a tubular sublattice of the simple cubic lattice, and use transfer-matrix and Monte Carlo methods to study their topological properties. In particular, we consider different ways of defining the âsizeâ of a knot relative to the length of the polymer, and find that the distribution of knot sizes is heavily dependent on the definition used. The relevance of these results to recent experiments involving DNA knots in solid-state nanopores will also be discussed.<br />Joint work with Christine E Soteros and Jeremy W Eng.</abstract></td>

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract115" style="display:none;">T-duality is a procedure for assigning to a Riemannian manifold with an abelian group of isometries another Riemannian manifold called the dual manifold. This dual manifold has the property that when used as a string background, it is physically indistinguishable from the original background. This notion has been generalised to Riemannian manifolds with a nonabelian group of isometries, and much more recently, to backgrounds without any isometries (but with some milder conditions). I will discuss work towards some new examples of this generalised T-duality.</abstract></td>

<td><em><a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="toggle('abstract175')">Free Field Realisations of Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories</a></em></td>
</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract175" style="display:none;">The symmetries of conformal field theory actually allow for the presence of logarithmic terms in correlation functions. In the last twenty years, many physically interesting examples of logarithmic theories have been found, notably including statistical models such as percolation and dilute polymers. State spaces associated to logarithmic theories exhibit non-diagonalisable action of the Virasoro algebra, and their construction has been approached in the literature by 'gluing' two highest weight Virasoro representations together in a nontrivial way. This talk presents recent work in applying this technique to Fock spaces in the hope of finding realisations of these representations in terms of the free boson. We will also see how logarithmic behaviour at the field level might correspond simply to an extension of the algebra at the mode level.<br /></abstract></td>

<td><abstract id="abstract111" style="display:none;">We compute the boundary entropy for bond percolation on the square lattice in the presence of a boundary loop weight, and prove explicit and exact expressions on a strip and on a cylinder of size L. For the cylinder we provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis which allows for the computation of finite-size corrections to arbitrary order. For the strip we provide exact expressions. Our rigorous and exact results corroborate an argument based on conformal field theory, in particular concerning universal logarithmic corrections for the case of the strip due to the presence of corners in the geometry. We furthermore observe a crossover at a special value of the boundary loop weight.<br />Joint work with Jesper Jacobsen and Anita Ponsaing.</abstract></td>

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract167" style="display:none;">We study the q-state Potts model on a simple cubic lattice with ferromagnetic interactions in one lattice direction, and antiferromagnetic interactions in the other two directions. As the temperature T decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition that fits in the universality class of the three-dimensional O(n) model with n = q â 1. This conclusion is based on the estimated critical exponents, and histograms of the order parameter. At even smaller T we find, for q = 4 and 5, a first-order transition to a phase with a different type of long-range order. This long-range order dissolves at T = 0, and the system effectively reduces to a disordered two-dimensional Potts antiferromagnet. These results are obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling.<br /></abstract></td>

They have combinatorial links to the six-vertex model as well as the alternating sign matrix problem. I will outline a constant term formula for the number of these paths, and discuss the relationship between the constant term of a rational function and the choice of Malcev-Neumann ring.</abstract></td>

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract144" style="display:none;">Finite-size scaling (FSS) is a fundamental physical theory within statistical mechanics, describing the asymptotic approach to the thermodynamic limit of finite systems in the neighbourhood of a critical phase transition. It is well-known that models of critical phenomena typically possess an upper critical dimension, d<sub>c</sub>, such that in dimensions d &gt; d<sub>c</sub>, their thermodynamic behaviour is governed by critical exponents taking simple mean-field values. In contrast to the simplicity of the thermodynamic behaviour, however, the theory of FSS in dimensions above d<sub>c</sub> is surprisingly subtle, and remains the subject of ongoing debate. We will argue that such subtleties can be explained in a simple way, by taking an appropriate geometric perspective. Our picture is supported by Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model and self-avoiding walk on five-dimensional hypercubic lattices.<br />Joint work with Eren M.

The combinatorial manipulations underlying the results involve exchange identities exploiting the Hopf-algebraic structure of certain symmetric function series and their plethysms. J. Phys. A: Math.

<td><abstract id="abstract130" style="display:none;">More than 15 years ago Guttmann and VÃ¶ge  [J. Statist. Plann. Inference, <b>101</b>, 107 (2002)],  introduced  a model of friendly walkers. Since then it has remained unsolved.  We provide the exact solution to a closely allied model which essentially only differs in the boundary conditions.  The exact solution is expressed in terms of the reciprocal of the generating function for vicious walkers which is a D-finite function. However, ratios of D-finite functions are inherently not D-finite and in this case we prove that the friendly walkers generating function is the solution to a non-linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients, it is in other words D-algebraic. We find using numerically exact calculations  a conjectured expression  for the generating function of the original model as a ratio of a  D-finite function and  the generating function for vicious walkers. We obtain an expression for this D-finite function in terms of a hypergeometric function with a rational pullback and its first and second derivatives.</abstract></td>

<td><abstract id="abstract140" style="display:none;">The star-triangle relation (STR) is a fundamental relation for integrability of two-dimensional lattice models of statistical mechanics, that first arose over 72 years ago in Onsager's solution of the 2-d Ising model.  In the last decade or so, it has become evident that STR is also a key relation for several other areas of mathematical physics, and provides new correspondences from the latter areas to integrable lattice models.  Such correspondences are a powerful tool for gaining insight into the different areas that are connected through STR.

</tr><tr><td></td>
<td><abstract id="abstract103" style="display:none;">Delays arise in many areas, including control theory, communication systems, electrodynamics and laser physics. When they are sufficiently large with respect to the internal time scales of the system under consideration, delays need to be taken into account in the mathematical description. This leads to models in the form of delay-differential equations, which are a special class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. The talk will demonstrate how advanced methods from dynamical systems can be brought to bear to gain insight into the overall dynamics of systems with delays.
<p>Specifically, the talk will present a case study of a semiconductor laser receiving time-delayed and frequency-filtered optical feedback (FOF) from two external filters. This system is referred to as the 2FOF laser, and it has been used as pump laser in optical telecommunication and as light source in sensor applications. Our analysis of the 2FOF laser focuses on the basic solutions of the underlying DDE, known as external filtered modes (EFMs), which correspond to laser output with steady amplitude and frequency. We consider the EFM-surface in the space of steady-state frequency, the corresponding steady-state population inversion, and the feedback phase difference. The EFM-surface emerges as a natural object, because it allows us to give a complete classification of the EFM structure in dependence on system parameters, including the detunings and width of the filters and the two delay times. To achieve this, we employ singularity theory in conjunction with continuation methods to determine how the parameter space is divided into regions of geometrically different types of EFM surface. Finally, we show that there are bands and islands of stability related to the type of EFM-surface that may be accessible and distinguishable experimentally.</p>

The symmetries of a conformal field theory include all angle-preserving transformations. In two dimensions, these transformations generate the Virasoro algebra, a powerful symmetry that allows one to calculate observable quantities analytically.The symmetries of a conformal field theory may be strictly larger than the Virasoro algebra. One possibility which is crucial importance to string theory applications is that of supersymmetry, where the Virasoro algebra is extended by a given number of fermionic fields.

<td><abstract id="abstract128" style="display:none;">When unlinked, unknotted vortex loops are formed helicity may fail to detect topological complexity accurately. By using and extending earlier results (Liu &amp; Ricca 2012), we derive the skein relations of the HOMFLYPT polynomial for ideal fluid knots from helicity, thus providing a rigorous proof that the HOMFLYPT polynomial is a new, powerful invariant of topological fluid mechanics (Liu &amp; Ricca 2015). Since this invariant is a two-variable polynomial, the skein relations are derived from two independent equations expressed in terms of writhe and twist contributions. Writhe is given by addition/subtraction of imaginary local paths, and twist by Dehn's surgery. HOMFLYPT then becomes a function of knot topology and field strength. For illustration we derive explicit expressions for some elementary cases and apply these results to homogeneous vortex tangles. Recently, by using this method, we prove that each stage of a cascade process, that follows a complexity-reducing path given by a sequence of T(2,2n+1) torus knots and T(2,2n) torus links produced by consecutive reconnections, can be detected by a unique, monotonically decreasing sequence of HOMFLYPT numerical values (Liu &amp; Ricca 2016). This opens the doors to useful applications in the study of the decay process of classical and quantum vortex tangles.<br /><br />

<td><abstract id="abstract102" style="display:none;">Out-of-equilibrium systems have nowadays an important role in 1d statistical physics. Although an equilibrium state obviously doesnât exist for such systems, one looks for a steady state (that is stationary in time). It is defined as the zero-eigenvalue eigenstate of the Markov matrix that describe the systems. Its exact computation is at the core of many researches. In some cases, the matrix product state ansatz (matrix ansatz for short) allows to compute this steady state. However no general approach for this ansatz is known. On the other hand, many 1d statistical models appear to be integrable, which allows to get eigenstates of the Markov matrix through Bethe ansatz. The goal of this presentation is to show how integrability gives a natural framework to construct the matrix ansatz for 1d systems with boundaries. It can be done on very general grounds, allowing to construct the matrix ansatz when it is not known, and also to define new models and/or to find boundary conditions âadaptedâ to the model under consideration. We will illustrate the technique on some examples.</abstract></td>

Simulation of rare events is a notoriously difficult task however. In the past decade, a number of advanced Monte Carlo techniques have been introduced to investigate the LDF of macroscopic observables in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The Iterative Measurement-and-Feedback method is a powerful method introduced recently in [1]. For this method to be feasible in practice, it needs to be augmented with a so-called "effective description" of the system being studied. Such effective descriptions have been conjectured and tested numerically, for a number of models including TASEP. In this talk we use Bethe ansatz to construct, and rigorously justify the effective description of TASEP on a ring.<br />Joint work with Timothy M. Garoni.</abstract></td>
