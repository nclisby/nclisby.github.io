Fateev. Potential applications of this correspondence to the problem of non-perturbative quantization of classically integrable non-linear sigma models are briefly discussed. </td>

<td> The collapse transition of a polymer in a dilute solution is usually modelled with a self-avoiding walk with an attractive interaction between nearest-neighbours. The balance of the attracting and repulsing forces identifies a tri-critical point, known as the $\theta$-point, which can be described as the tri-critical point of magnetic system with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit $n \to 0$. This description based on self-avoiding walks might not be the most general and the introduction of crossings might leads to a different and largely unexplored universality class. I will review some recent results on this topic. </td>

<td> The Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin (ADHM) construction can be seen as a correspondence between representations of the ADHM quiver and instantons over $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. For $SU(2)$ gauge field theory, Austin and Braam showed, via ADHM that circle-invariant instantons - hyperbolic magnetic monopoles in disguise - are solutions of a discretisation of Nahm's equations. We attempt to do the same for higher rank hyperbolic monopoles. </td>

<td> In this talk, we study the problem of data storage in a two-dimensional array. Hardware considerations induce constraints in the possible configurations of magnetic spins in this array, and the storage capacity can be found by modelling the constraints as lattice spin models. Using Baxter's corner transfer matrix formalism, we derive very accurate lower bounds on the capacities of several families of such constraints. Our results strongly improve on all previous known lower bounds, and lead to a surprising conjecture that the capacity of two of our studied constraints are equal. </td>

<td> I will discuss an inhomogeneous version of the asymmetric exclusion process. Using the Noumi representation of the Hecke algebra it is shown that the stationary state of this process is given in terms of elementary symmetric functions in the case of periodic boundary conditions, and in terms of non-symmetric one-column Koornwinder polynomials in the case of open, non-diagonal boundary conditions. As a corollary we find that one-column Koornwinder polynomials can be expressed explicitly in terms of matrix product states. </td>

<td> The study of exact solutions of quantum mechanical models has its origins in the work of Bethe  in 1931 on the Heisenberg model. The field received a great impulse in the 1960s and 1970s with  the work of Baxter, Lieb and Yang, among others, having prospered ever since. A significant aspect  of exactly solvable models is that they can be found in different  areas of physics, such as statistical  mechanics, quantum field theory, condensed matter, string theory and more recently in cold atoms.  The impressive development in cooling and trapping atoms in one-dimensional tubes brought this  discipline to a new audience, when it became clear that exactly solvable models can be realized in  the lab. Prominent examples include the Lieb-Liniger model for spinless bosons and the Gaudin-Yang  model for two-component fermions. 
<p>In this talk I will give an overview of these ongoing developments, with particular emphasis on the  one-dimensional attractive Fermi gas with spin imbalance, for which some recent results will also be  presented. This model exhibits a number of distinct quantum phases and provides an ideal testbed  for exploring the physics of quantum phase transitions. In addition, other exactly solvable models  relevant in this ultracold scenario will be discussed. </p></td>

<td> The Potts model is a fundamental model in equilibrium  statistical mechanics. The Swendsen-Wang process is the most widely  used Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm for studying the Potts model.  We study the Swendsen-Wang process for the Potts model with $q\ge3$  states on the complete graph $K_n$, and obtain the large $n$  asymptotics of the mixing time as a function of the inverse  temperature $\lambda$.  We show that the mixing time is exponentially large in a power of $n$  throughout a non-trivial neighbourhood $(\lambda_{\rm o}(q),  \lambda_{\rm d}(q))$ of the equilibrium transition temperature.  In the low temperature regime $\lambda\ge\lambda_{\rm d}(q)$, we find  the mixing time is $\Theta(\log n)$, while for high temperatures  $\lambda &lt; \lambda_{\rm o}(q)$ the mixing time is $O(1)$.  At $\lambda = \lambda_{\rm o}(q)$ the mixing time exhibits a  non-trivial power-law scaling $\Theta(n^{1/3})$. </td>

<td> We consider a self-avoiding walk model of polymer adsorption where the adsorbed  polymer can be desorbed by the application of a force, concentrating on the case of  the square lattice. We also consider self-avoiding polygons in a similar geometry, as models of adsorbed vesicles.  Using series analysis methods we investigate the behaviour of the  free energy of the system when there is an attractive potential $\epsilon$ with the surface and  a force $f$ applied at the last vertex (or top edge in the case of polygons), normal to the surface, and extract the phase  boundaries between the ballistic and adsorbed phases. We believe these to be exact to  graphical accuracy. We give precise estimates of the location of the transition from  the free phase to the ballistic phase, which we find to be at $y_c= \exp(f/k_BT_c) = 1,$  and from the free phase to the adsorbed phase, which we estimate to be at $a_c =  \exp(−\epsilon/k_BT_c) = 1.775615 \pm 0.000005.$ In addition we prove that the phase transition  from the ballistic to the adsorbed phase is first order in the case of SAWs. Various results about  the phase boundaries are proved. </td>

<td> Smooth representations of p-adic groups play an important role in number theory, in particular, in the Langlands program. Their characteristic zero analogues, smooth representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras, are crucial ingredients in Beilinson and Drinfeld's approach to the geometric Langlands program. In addition, these representations play a role in conformal field theories with affine Kac-Moody symmetries. In this talk, I will introduce two classes of representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras: generalized Verma modules and generalized Wakimoto modules. I will also explain the relationship between these modules and their more classical analogues. </td>

<td> The formalism to determine (conformal) isometries of a given curved superspace was elaborated almost two decades ago in the context of the old minimal formulation for N=1 supergravity in four dimensions. This formalism is  universal, for it may readily be generalized to supersymmetric backgrounds associated with any supergravity theory formulated in superspace. In the last two years, there have appeared a number of publications devoted to the construction of supersymmetric backgrounds in off-shell four-dimensional N=1 supergravity theories using component field considerations. Here we demonstrate how to read off the key results of these recent publications from the more general superspace approach developed in the 1990s. This talk is based on arXiv:1212.6179. </td>

<td> Parafermionic observables have become an important tool in understanding the scaling limit of critical two-dimensional lattice models. These are functions defined on the lattice, satisfying some linear condition that is a discrete analogue of holomorphicity. They have been used to prove various conformal invariance conjectures related to the Ising model and percolation and more recently their connections with integrability have been investigated. In this talk we consider these observables away from the critical point. We show how such off-critical parafermionic observables can be used to determine the winding angle distribution of self-avoiding walks, first predicted by Duplantier and Saleur using Conformal Field Theory, and we also discuss their integrabliity. </td>

Our construction can be naturally extended to arbitrary real values   of spin and the limit to (half)-integer values of $s$ is non-singular. </td>

<td> Planar algebras have found applications in the description of lattice models in statistical mechanics with non-local degrees of freedom. Of particular importance are the diagrammatic objects known as transfer tangles since certain representations thereof correspond to lattice model transfer matrices. Working in the planar Temperley-Lieb algebra, we discuss how the corresponding transfer tangles satisfy various functional relations. A fusion procedure based on applications of the Wenzl-Jones projectors is used to describe and prove these relations. This approach gives rise to a fusion hierarchy which can be reformulated as so-called Y-systems of importance in the analysis of integrable models. </td>

<td> I will describe interesting rational solutions to a linear difference equation coming from the Lax operator for the Toda lattice.  This gives an example of a quantum curve related to the Gromov-Witten invariants of the two-sphere.  It confirms one case of a conjecture of Gukov and Sulkowksi regarding the existence of quantum curves. </td>

<td> I will present a new solution found which corresponds to large inhomogeneities - also called spikes - with an electromagnetic field within the context of General Relativity, more specifically, cosmology. Apart from describing its properties I will point out why this solution is interesting. It is related to a certain symmetry, called Gowdy symmetry. Gowdy symmetric cosmologies are extremely popular within Theoretical Cosmology. The reason is, that it is a toy model which is easy to handle but which still corresponds to an inhomogeneous spacetime. The presented work is based on a transformation between Vacuum Gowdy spacetimes and Polarized Gowdy spacetimes with a Maxwell field. I would like to understand better the existence of this transformation and the possible relation to a discrete symmetry property of these spacetimes. </td>

<td> Conformal field theories should be definable on tori, hence their partition functions must be invariant under the natural action of the modular group $\mathsf{SL}{2;\mathbb{Z}}$.  Thus, it is not surprising to find that the characters of the irreducible chiral algebra modules typically span an $\mathsf{SL}{2;\mathbb{Z}}$-module.  All this works beautifully in the rational case where all modules are completely reducible and there are finitely many inequivalent irreducible modules.  Thus, it is not surprising to find that many groups have studied the modular properties of characters in the $C_2$-cofinite case where there are still only finitely many inequivalent irreducibles, but complete reducibility is dropped.  However, the results are not particularly encouraging.  Here, I outline a much more encouraging formalism for non-rational theories in which we drop the finiteness condition instead (and, optionally, the complete reducibility).  The $C_2$-cofinite case can, at least in examples, be recovered using orbifold technology. </td>

<td> We present a one-dimensional nonlocal hopping model with exclusion on a   ring. The model is related to the Raise and Peel growth model. A   nonnegative parameter u controls the local backwards and nonlocal forwards   hopping rates. The phase diagram and consequently the values of the   current depend on u and the density of particles. In the special case of   half-filling and u = 1 the system is conformal invariant and an exact   value of the current for any size L of the system is conjectured and   checked in Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss various aspects of the   model. </td>

<td> Integrable partial difference equations (or lattice equations) have been systematically studied since the 1980s and have seen an explosion of interest in recent years. Some of them yield well-known integrable partial differential equations like the Korteweg-de Vries or Sine-Gordon equations in the continuum limit.  
<p>What do we mean by the term ``Integrable''? This meaning is itself part of the research impetus in Discrete Integrable Systems. Integrable means ``special'', loosely-speaking, and may refer to one or more ``special'' properties that the dynamics possesses. Here we focus on the property of algebraic entropy of lattice equations: growth of degree in an indeterminate variable inserted in the boundary conditions as the lattice rule is iterated. Exponential growth is the norm, but integrable rules are distinguished numerically by polynomial growth which means vanishing algebraic entropy. </p>
<p>In the first part of the talk, we provide exact results that prove polynomial growth for a whole class of equations, including most of the much-studied Adler-Bobenko-Suris list. For other equations where the degree of cancelled terms at each vertex is not high enough, we prove exponential growth. In the second part of the talk, we study integrable lattice equations and their non-integrable perturbations over finite fields. We propose some models and discuss some tests that can distinguish different growth properties between them, and discuss the limitations of these tests. </p>
<p>Both parts of the talk are joint work with Dinh Tran. </p></td>

<td> We review a model of two friendly walks near a wall with shared and surface interactions. The full solution of the corresponding generating function and phase diagram are presented. We then discuss what insights our solution provides when considering the model of $n &gt; 2$ interacting friendly walks in the bulk, introducing some preliminary results for $n=3$. </td>

<td> We propose a new off-shell formulation for N-extended conformal supergravity in three spacetime dimensions. Our construction is based on the gauging of the N-extended superconformal algebra in superspace. By using our new formulation we construct the off-shell actions for conformal supergravity theories with $N=1,2,\ldots,6$. </td>

<td> In 2006, science fiction became science fact with the construction of the world's first invisibility, or cloaking, device.  The physical realization of the cloak resulted from the confluence of the recent development of ``metamaterials'' -- engineered materials that derive their characteristic electromagnetic response properties from embedded structural elements -- with a new mathematical approach to designing field-controlling devices that is becoming known as the transformation method.  In a nutshell, the transformation method is based on the covariance of a governing system of equations under some set of transformations, together with the interpretation of the transformations as ``active'' rather than ``passive.''  One is then required to solve the inverse problem of: given a desired field behaviour (e.g. light passing through a cloaking device), what are the required system parameters that will support the desired fields as a solution to the equations?  Whether the necessary system parameters can be physically realized is largely an engineering problem, but through further study we may find techniques to improve the chances of success. 
<p> I will give an introduction to the field of transformation optics, show how one goes about designing a cloaking device, and discuss how the transformation method has been extended beyond optics, in particular to acoustics and thermodynamics.  In the process I hope to show that there is a lot of interesting mathematics and physics lurking under the metamaterial-clad surface. </p></td>

<td> We construct a series of logarithmic conformal field models using an ideology  of screenings. In the space generated by several free fields we consider  a system of screenings that generate quantum sl(2|1) with the deformation  parameter at root of unity. The vacuum module of the logarithmic models   is obtained as an intersection of kernels of two screenings. </td>

<td> The Baxter Q-operators were originally introduced by Baxter when he solved the   8-vertex model. His method of the Q-operators is recognized as one of   the most powerful tools in quantum integrable systems.  
<p>Our goal is to construct the Q-operators systematically, to express the T-operators (transfer matrices)   in terms of the Q-operators, and to establish functional relations among them.   For this purpose, we consider an embedding of the quantum integrable systems   into the soliton theory. The key object is the master T-operator (tau-function in the   soliton theory), which is a sort of a generating function of the transfer matrices.   The Q-operators are defined as residues of the master T-operator.   </p>
<p> The Q-operators can also be defined as the trace of monodromy matrices,  which are product of some L-operators. In general, such L-operators   are image of the universal R-matrix for q-oscillator representations of a   Borel subalgebra of the quantum affine algebra. I will also mention the   construction of such L-operators for the Q-operators. </p></td>

<td> We consider a problem of cubic and quartic interactions for massless and massive higher spin fields on flat and AdS backgrounds. After describing the procedure of building of the corresponding cubic and quartic vertices and showing some explicit examples we perform various consistency checks on the interaction terms. In particular for  vertices for massive higher spin fields  on a flat background we perform the Velo - Zwanziger analysis, and for  vertices for massless higher spin fields on a flat background we perform the analysis of the symmetries of the S-matrix. </td>

The problem of determining matrix element formulae for the $gl(m|n)$ generators is discussed. We determine these results via the characteristic identity and shift operator formalism. I will introduce this technique and show how the resulting factorization allows a direct, non-recursive formula for the non-elementary generators to be given for a large class of finite dimensional modules. </td>
