<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Title:</SPAN> Fluctuation relations and the foundations of statistical
thermodynamics: a deterministic approach 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Presenter:</SPAN> Debra J. Searles (Bernhardt) 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> The University of Queensland 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Authors:</SPAN> Debra J. Searles (Bernhardt), James C. Reid, Stephen R. Williams, Lamberto Rondoni and Denis J. Evans. 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
The fluctuation theorem and the work relation are exact nonequilibrium thermodynamic relations developed almost two decades ago. In the intervening time these relations have been applied to prove a number of new theorems including the dissipation theorem, the relaxation theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator and various phase function representations. They can also be applied to provide a proof of Boltzmann's postulate of equal a priori probability and a proof of the relationship between the phase space volume, the physical volume, the energy and the thermodynamic entropy and temperature for the equilibrium microcanonical ensemble. We will discuss these relationships and their application to some model systems.

<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> Paul Fendley 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> University of Virginia 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
Long ago the Ising model was solved by rewriting the spins in terms of
Majorana fermionic variables. More recent studies have shown how the
Ising ordered phase described in terms of the fermions is a simple
example of topological order. I will explain what topological order is,
and explain how this and other topological concepts are quite useful in
studying spin systems. One example I will discuss is the role
parafermionic zero modes play in chiral clock/Potts models. More
generally, I will explain how two-dimensional integrable lattice models
play a major role in understanding two-dimensional quantum models with
topological order.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Title:</SPAN> Integrable dynamics: practical applications and abstract theory 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> Jarmo Hietarinta 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> University of Turku 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> Integrable systems were studied already in the late 1800's and their
active development started again after the seminal paper of Zabusky and
Kruskal in 1965. In this paper they demonstrated elastic scattering in
the Korteweg-de Vries equation and coined the term ``soliton''.
Subsequently many interesting mathematical properties of integrable
systems were revealed, along with practical applications. I will present
three different classes of equations and corresponding definitions of
integrability specially suited for them. Finally I will demonstrate that
even though different classes of integrable systems were originally
defined by different criteria, there are in fact various connections
between them.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Title:</SPAN> Quantum integrable systems and curve counting 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> Andrei Okounkov 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> Columbia University 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
Quantum cohomology is a deformation of the classical cohomology algebra of an algebraic variety X that takes into account enumerative geometry of rational curves in X.  For many interesting varieties, it can be described in terms of certain quantum integrable systems. For example, Givental and Kim described the quantum cohomology of flag manifolds in terms of Toda lattices. A general vision for a connection between quantum cohomology and quantum integrable systems recently emerged in supersymmetric gauge theories, in particular in the work of Nekrasov and Shatashvili. In this lecture, I will describe an approach to these problems developed in my joint work with Davesh Maulik.

We present exact solutions to the Schr&#246;dinger equation with the double Morse potential, consisting of two back-to-back Morse functions. The resulting differential equation is found to be quasi-exactly solvable and closed form energies and wavefunctions are obtained using the Bethe ansatz method. The results obtained are used as prototype description for the of hydrogen-bonded crystals COOH and KDP as well as their deuteriated cases.

 Integrability as a consequence of Discrete Holomorphicity

<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> 
 Australian National University 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> In the past few years, discretely holomorphic observables have 
been identified in several solvable lattice models at criticality. The 
existence of rhombic embeddings of general Baxter lattices allows us to 
consider the condition of discrete holomorphicityon these embeddings 
onto the complex plane. We show that, by considering the contour sum 
around adjacent rhombi, the integrability of the underlying model can be 
demonstrated. In particular, both the Yang-Baxter equations and the 
inversion relations, the main ingredients of the commuting transfer 
matrix method, can be derived from the contour sums.

The 1+1-dimensonal Hubbard model in condensed matter physics describe two interacting  
XY-chains. The model was solved by Bethe Ansatz a long time ago, but the associated Yang-Baxter structure still remains obscure. In particular, an absence of the "difference property" in the model 
might be a manifestation of a hidden 3D structure. In this talk I will review various attempts to connect the Hubbard model with 3D integrable systems.

 Self-avoiding trails with nearest neighbour interactions on the square lattice 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> 
  Andrea Bedini 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> 
 The University of Melbourne 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
Self-avoiding walks and self-avoiding trails, two models of a polymer
coil in dilute solution, have been shown to be governed by the same
universality class.  On the other hand, self-avoiding walks interacting
via nearest-neighbour contacts (ISAW) and self-avoiding trails
interacting via multiply-visited sites (ISAT) are two models of the
collapse transition of a polymer in dilute solution and, on the square
lattice, it has been established numerically that their collapse
transitions lie in different universality classes.  The two models
differ in two substantial ways: in the types of subsets of random walk
configurations utilised (site self-avoidance versus bond self-avoidance)
and in the type of attractive interaction. It is therefore of some
interest to consider self-avoiding trails interacting via nearest
neighbour attraction (INNSAT) in order to ascertain the source for the
difference in the collapse universality class.

A variational approach for a class of exactly solvable BEC-BCS crossover Hamiltonians
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> 
  Andrew Birrell 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> 
 The University of Queensland 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
 By combining aspects of both the co-ordinate Bethe ansatz and algebraic Bethe ansatz we determine very general classes of exactly solvable Hamiltonians . This approach does not depend on any prior knowledge of a solution of the Yang-Baxter Equation, nor the conserved operators of the Hamiltonian it generates. By taking a variational form for the Hamiltonian and eigenstates we obtain general exact solvability conditions. The procedure is conducted in the framework of Hamiltonians describing the crossover between the low-temperature phenomena of superconductivity, in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC).

 On the K-theory classification of topological states of matter 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> 
  Peter Bouwknegt 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> 
 Australian National University 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
Topological insulators and superconductors are many-fermion 
systems possessing an unusual band structure that leads to a bulk band gap
as well as topologically protected gapless extended surface modes (known as 
the `bulk-boundary correspondence').
It was recently realised by Kitaev, that deformation classes of gapped 
Hamiltonians are naturally classified by K-theory.  This 
classification parallels the classification of the 2 complex and 8 real symmetry 
classes of Hamiltonians (the `10-fold way') of Altland and Zirnbauer,
and naturally leads to a periodic table of topological insulators.
In this talk I will give a brief overview of these developments.  I will also
describe how the bulk-boundary correspondence fits in with the K-theory picture.

<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> Tony Bracken 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> Department of Mathematics, The University of Queensland 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> An established model of steady one-dimensional two-ion electrodiffusion
across a liquid junction involves three coupled first-order nonlinear
ordinary differential equations, and has the second-order Painlev&#233; II
equation at its core.  Solutions are grouped by B&#228;cklund
transformations into infinite sequences, each characterized by
evenly-spaced quantized fluxes of the two ionic species, and hence
evenly-spaced quantization of the electric current-density. For the
sequence generated from a particular exact solution, first constructed
by Planck, this flux quantization is  shown to reflect the underlying
quantization of electric charge.

This talk will show how the Bethe Ansatz can be used to solve a set of coupled partial difference equations for osculating lattice paths. Osculating paths are sets of directed square lattice paths that are allowed to share vertices but not edges. The paths occur in the six vertex model and alternating sign matrix enumeration.

Many Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) require the existence of magnetic monopoles. In Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge field theory, they arise as soliton solutions, tying together topology, algebraic geometry and integrable systems. The euclidean case has been studied extensively but the hyperbolic picture is still incomplete. I will speak about the spectral curve and holomorphic sphere associated to a hyperbolic monopole.

We introduce a self-avoiding walk model for which

Random rectangle-triangle tilings are non-free fermionic generalisations of rhombus tilings that were discovered in the late nineties. I will discuss three such tilings that are Bethe ansatz solvable. The Bethe integral equations have a non-trivial monodromy related to SL(2,Z) which reduces to a finite cyclic monodromy in special cases. It was recently pointed out that the general case has an interesting connection to Painleve VI.

 Unstable Klein-Gordon modes in an accelerating universe
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Author:</SPAN> 
  Kathryn Deutscher 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> 
 La Trobe University 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
Current observations show the universe to be made up predominantly of ``dark energy,'' (energy that has no particle or radiation interpretation). It is known that when unstable modes are quantised, there is no Fock representation and therefore no particle or radiation interpretation. In this sense, these modes might be regarded as dark energy.

<P>
We develop a full solution of a scalar quantum field coupled to an accelerating universe. In the case of minimal coupling of massless fields, there exist modes that become unstable at a discrete sequence of times. After canonical quantisation, these unstable modes represent energy eigenstates that can be viewed as neither particle nor oscillatory radiation. We then partition the energy into stable and unstable components. As time increases, modes of increasing wave number cease to be oscillatory and become unstable. The number of unstable modes remains finite, guaranteeing a preferred physical representation for the system.

A domain wall theory for the prioritising exclusion process

  Caley Finn 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Affiliation:</SPAN> 
 The University of Melbourne 
 
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
The prioritising exclusion process is a model for the operation of
hospital queues where customers (patients) are classified as high or
low priority. Upon arrival, customers of both classes join the back of
the queue, but a high priority customer can overtake a low priority
customer immediately ahead of them, so that the order of service
depends on priority class as well as time spent in the queue. The
overtaking is analogous to the particle hopping in the asymmetric
exclusion process (ASEP). However, as customers arrive and are served
the queue grows and shrinks so, unlike the ASEP, the system does not
have a fixed length. We show that this system is well described by a
domain wall theory, and, in fact, this picture is exact for certain
regions of the parameter space.

It has long been appreciated that exactly solved mathematical models
describing the statistical mechanics of interacting particles have played
a key role in the development of formerly unrelated areas of mathematics
and theoretical physics, such as the study of knots, links and braids,
quantum groups, combinatorics, conformal field theory and condensed matter
physics. However, over the past few years striking experimental
achievements in trapping and
cooling atoms in one-dimensional optical waveguides have provided
remarkable realisations of exactly solved models in the lab. More
generally the study of cold atomic matter provides a unique environment to
explore novel quantum many-body effects like  quantum liquids, quantum
correlations and quantum criticality. In this talk I will describe some of
these fundamental mathematical models and their relevance to recent and
future experiments on such  exotic many-body physics.

A decade ago the problem was posed of Brownian motion originating at the
centre of a 10 x 1 rectangle, and the problem posed was calculation of
the ratio of probabilities of a Brownian path hitting the short end of
the rectangle before hitting one of the long sides. Surprisingly, for
Brownian motion this probability can be calculated exactly. Here we
consider instead the problem of a self-avoiding walk in the scaling
limit, and pose the same question. Assuming that the scaling limit of
SAW is conformally invariant, we evaluate, asymptotically, the same
ratio of probabilities. For the SAW case we find the probability ratio
is approximately 200 times greater than for Brownian motion.

One way of studying a Riemann surface is to endow it with its canonical

simple idea is the basis for much of Teichmuller space theory, and enables
us to study the moduli space of Riemann surfaces from the hyperbolic
perspective.

A modification on this theme is to introduce cone-point singularities to
our hyperbolic metric. But this quickly runs into trouble as we lose

We discuss highest weight representations of a class of conformal Galilei algebras in one spatial dimension with central extension. This is done by explicitly constructing all singular vectors within the Verma modules and deducing irreducibility of the associated highest weight quotient modules. A resulting classification of infinite dimensional irreducible modules is presented. We deduce a formula for the Kac determinant from our construction, thus proving a conjecture of Dobrev, Doebner and Mrugalla for the case of the Schrodinger algebra.

The master solution of the star triangle relation introduced by Bazhanov and Sergeev, describes an exactly solvable lattice model of statistical mechanics with continuous spins and positive Boltzmann weights. Many different limits of this model can be taken which result in new integrable models. I will describe these limits and give two explicit examples. I will also show how the low temperature (quasi-classical) limit of these models are connected to the discrete integrable equations of Adler, Bobenko and Suris.

Until recently all known examples of superintegrable Hamiltonians were systems on constant curvature spaces, or by Staeckel transform, on conformally-flat spaces.  Methods developed to investigate the superintegrability of the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz system can be extended to a non-conformally-flat superintegrable system in 4 dimensions possessing irreducible higher rank Killing tensors.  These Killing tensors give rise to higher order symmetries of a conformally covariant Laplacian that is not simply the usual one with a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

In two-dimensional lattice models, there exist certain observables that are discretely holomorphic in the sense that they satisfy a discrete analogue of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Recent work by Cardy, Ikhlef and others has shown a surprising connection between discrete holomorphicity and integrability. In this talk I will be describing this connection in models where there is a boundary. By requiring that the observable satisfy certain boundary conditions, we are able to obtain new integrable boundary weights for several loop models.

 In my talk I will discuss a new form of one-particle relativistic
 quantum mechanics with a proper probabilistic interpretation, proposed
 by A. Lukyanenko and N. Gorobey (Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical
 University). The problem of probabilistic interpretation of the
 ordinary one-particle relativistic quantum mechanics comes from the
 hyperbolic structure of the Klein-Gordon equation, which does not
 conserve positive definite properties. It has been solved by secondary
 quantization of the theory (quantum field theory), but it is not the
 only possible solution. We propose a modification of the original
 theory in which the internal time of a particle is introduced. For this
 purpose we consider a quantum analogue of the classical action
 principle, where the role of a quantum action is played by the phase
 function of a solution of the Schr&#246;dinger equation. The internal
 time is determined by the condition of stationarity of the quantum
 action. Then, the stationary solution becomes a density of probability,
 in which time, equally to spatial coordinates, is a stochastic
 parameter. The correspondence of the new theory with non-relativistic
 quantum mechanics will be discussed.

The Bethe ansatz is a key tool in the area of quantum integrable and
exactly solvable models. For each such model, understanding the nature
of the roots of the Bethe ansatz equations is central to understanding
the mathematical physics underpinning the model's behaviour. Here we
analyse an exactly solvable, non-hermitian BCS pairing Hamiltonian
dependent on a real-valued coupling parameter. The Hamiltonian displays
a real spectrum for all values of this coupling parameter.  The roots of
the Bethe ansatz equations can be categorized into two classes, those
which are dependent on the coupling parameter and those which are not.
We will discuss how those roots which are independent of the coupling
parameter can be associated to exotic quasi-particles obeying
generalised exclusion statistics, in the sense proposed by Haldane in
1991.

For each simple Lie algebra g consider the vacuum module V(g)
at the critical level over the corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra.
The vacuum module has a vertex algebra structure.
We construct explicit generators of the center of this vertex algebra
for all Lie algebras g of classical types. This gives a new proof of
the Feigin-Frenkel theorem (1992) and leads to explicit constructions
of commutative subalgebras of the universal enveloping
algebras U(g[t]) and U(g), and to higher order Hamiltonians
in the Gaudin model associated with g. Moreover, we use Yangian characters
(or q-characters) to calculate the images of the central elements under
an affine version of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism.

Another common context for these problems is Frobenius manifolds which can be used to give a rigorous notion of mirror symmetry in each case.  I will describe a relation between Eynard-Orantin invariants and Frobenius manifolds.

We specifically consider two walks that begin and end together so as to

interaction parameter is assigned to configurations where both polymers
touch the wall simultaneously, and investigate the effect this parameter
has on the integrability of the problem. We find an exact solution of
the generating function of the model, and provide a full analysis of the
phase diagram that admits three phases with one first-order and two

We consider domino tilings of square lattices on rectangles, cylinders and tori.

These sectors are labelled by an integer or half-integer quantum number we call the variation index. In the continuum scaling limit, each sector gives rise to a representation of the Virasoro algebra. We discuss the corresponding partition functions and how similarities with the critical dense polymer model yield natural finitizations by means of physical combinatorics.

<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Abstract:</SPAN> 
  The modular properties of fractional level WZW models and, in
  particular, the application of the Verlinde formula, have a long and
  checkered history in conformal field theory.  Such theories were
  postulated in the late eighties as a means of generalising the
  GKO-coset construction of the unitary minimal models to their
  non-unitary cousins.  Unfortunately, while their modular properties
  appeared satisfactory, the Verlinde formula (which is supposed to give
  the dimensions of certain vector spaces) always gave a few negative
  integers in addition to the expected non-negative ones.  This
  notorious problem is referred to in textbooks as suggesting that
  fractional level theories are ``intrinsically sick''.

<P>
Luckily, the formalism of logarithmic conformal field theory has led to a radically new approach to this issue.  We will survey the shift in paradigm that has recently been shown to cure the fractional level theories based on affine sl(2) of all sickness.  If time permits, we will then discuss (with examples) a selection of the beautiful mathematics that has been used to finally resolve this long-standing problem.

In a conformal invariant one-dimensional stochastic model, a certain
non-local perturbation takes the system to a new massless phase of a
special kind. The ground-state of the system is an adsorptive state.
Part of the finite-size scaling spectrum of the evolution Hamiltonian
stays unchanged but some levels go exponentially to zero for large
lattice sizes becoming degenerate with the ground-state. As a
consequence one observes the appearance of quasistationary states which
have a relaxation time which grows exponentially with the size of the
system. Several initial conditions have singled out a quasistationary
state which has in the finite-size scaling limit the same properties as
the stationary state of the conformal invariant model.

Duality is a fundamental concept that underlies almost all natural
phenomena.  The inner beauty in general systems are bound up with
duality.  In this talk, the speaker will present a potentially useful
canonical duality theory for solving discrete dynamical systems governed
by logistic equation. In nonlinear dynamics, the chaotic behaviour is
mainly due to non-convexity of the objective function.  How to identify
the global stability and extremality of the critical solutions is a
challenge task. The speaker will first show that by using the finite
difference and least squares, nonlinear differential equation can be
converted into a non-convex optimization with unknown parameter, which
is equivalent to a concave maximization problem by using canonical dual
transformation. Applications will be illustrated by a study on the
population dynamics of fisheries. The method can be applied to many
NP-hard problems in global optimization and computational science, such
as integer programming, network optimization and travelling salesman
problem (TSP), etc.  This talk should bring some new insights into
non-convex analysis, nonlinear dynamics and computational methods.

We introduce new two-dimensional exactly solvable superconformal loop
models generalising the logarithmic minimal models. These models include
superconformal polymers and superconformal percolation as the first
members. The superconformal loop models are constructed using the
generators of a one-parameter specialisation of the
Birman-Wenzl-Murakami (BMW) algebra arising from fusion of the
Temperley-Lieb algebra. The BMW algebra extends the Temperley-Lieb
algebra by allowing over- and under-crossings of loop segments. In the
continuum scaling limit, the new models describe logarithmic
superconformal minimal Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). The link states
for these models are constructed, and we find they are counted by
Riordan and Motzkin numbers. Finite-size corrections are studied to
obtain the central charges, conformal dimensions and finitised conformal
characters associated with the corresponding superconformal logarithmic
minimal models. The analytic and numerical findings are in agreement
with general theory giving these logarithmic CFTs as a ``logarithmic
limit'' of the rational superconformal minimal models.

We generalize the directed percolation (DP) model by relaxing the strict directionality of DP
  such that propagation can occur in either direction but with anisotropic probabilities. We denote
  the probabilities as <!-- MATH
 $p_{\downarrow}= p \cdot p_d$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 $p_{\uparrow}=p \cdot (1-p_d)$
 -->

 ALT="$ p_d$"></SPAN> controlling the anisotropy.
  The Leath-Alexandrowicz method is used to grow a cluster from an active seed site. 
  We call this model with two main growth directions <EM>biased directed percolation</EM> (BDP).
  Standard isotropic percolation (IP) and DP are the two limiting cases of the BDP model, 
  corresponding to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img25.png"
 ALT="$ p_d=1/2$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="64" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img26.png"
 ALT="$ p_d=0,1$"></SPAN> respectively.

<P>
In this work, besides IP and DP, we also consider the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ 1/2&lt;p_d&lt;1$"></SPAN> region.
  Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out on the square 
  and the simple-cubic lattices, and the numerical data are analyzed by
  finite-size scaling. We locate the percolation thresholds of the BDP model for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$ p_d=0.6$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.png"
 ALT="$ 0.8$"></SPAN>, 
  and determine various critical exponents. 
  These exponents are found to be consistent with those for standard DP. 
  We also determine the renormalization exponent associated with the asymmetric 
  perturbation due to <!-- MATH
 $p_d -1/2 \neq 0$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img30.png"
 ALT="$ p_d -1/2 \neq 0$"></SPAN> near IP, and confirm that such an asymmetric scaling field is relevant at IP.
