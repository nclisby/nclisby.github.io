                <p>
                On this page I briefly describe how to set up a Google Alert for
                efficient detection of improperly shared questions. It does not
                seem to be a novel idea, and I make no claim whatsoever to having
                originated it! I first used this setup in semester 2 of 2020 (that is, from
                August-November) as a tool to detect cheating for assessments in
                my first- and second-year mathematics classes.
                Although my background is in maths, the technique described here can work for
                any discipline.
                </p>

                This tip is mentioned in the following publication: Nathan Clisby &amp; Antony Edwards (2021) 
                <b>Individualized summative assessments as
                    used during COVID-19</b>, International Journal of Mathematical Education in
Science and Technology, DOI: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0020739X.2021.1982040">10.1080/0020739X.2021.1982040</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                And, the material on this webpage was prepared as a <a
                    href="clisby_edwards_google_alerts.pdf">pdf presentation</a>
                by Ant Edwards and me for a roundtable discussion at
                the <a
                    href="https://torrens.eventsair.com/aain-forum2021/">Australian
                    Academic Integrity Network Forum 2021</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                I&rsquo;ll add the caveat that there is clearly much more to
                academic integrity than this! Ideally one would work on
                fostering positive behaviours, and not just punishing negative
                behaviours. My goal in writing this up is just to add an extra
                tool to your arsenal.

                    other websites where contract cheating can potentially occur.

                    <li>
                    Google crawls the entire web frequently and so alerts are typically received within
hours of a question appearing.
</li>
<li>
Quick detection acts as disincentive to cheat, and reduces exposure of questions
and solutions in the wild.

                    <li>
                    Prior to release of the assessment, set up a Google Alert
                    that searches for text
fragments from the assessment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    If any hits are detected you will receive an email alert from Google with the URL.

                    <li>
                    If assessment is provided to students as a pdf file then it is best to
                    extract text snippets from the pdf rather than the source
                    text (say LaTeX or Word).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    E.g.: <i>"Sketch the graph of an even function f (x) that is defined for" OR
"Sketch the graph of an odd function g(t) that is defined for" OR
"function. Determine if the function"</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    For individualised assessments ensure that snippets are common to all versions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    6 words of mathematical text, even with common words, will result in few hits.
                    </li>

                    Chegg is indexed by Google. This is Chegg&rsquo;s choice, presumably because it drives
traffic to their site and improves profits.

                    <li>
                    Chegg will takedown questions within a couple of days of a request, and provide
account information of question submitter.

                    <li>
                    Typically this account information will not identify the student, as users can sign
up with any email address.

                    <li>
                    Ideally: generate unique questions for each student, and that way identification
can occur purely based on question that has been shared.
