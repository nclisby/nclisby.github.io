            Below is a synopsis of my
            research interests, with a more detailed list of possible
            research topics and directions for potential students and
            collaborators on the <a
                href="topics/">topics</a> page (30/12/14: empty for now, 
            will be added to over the coming weeks). 
            My publications are
            listed and many talks are available for download on my <a
                href="publications/">publications</a> page.
            Please visit the <a
                href="/projects/">projects</a> page
            if you are interested in seeing visualisations of my work.

            <p>
            For the moment I'm going to keep this quite
            brief, but I will  either extend or refine the writing later.
            </p>
            <p>
            My main field of research is statistical mechanics, which is
            the study of systems with many, many constituents, with the
            goal of understanding how these constituents can cooperate
            to bring about global changes of state, otherwise known as
            phase transitions. Typical examples of phase transitions are
            liquid water freezing, or boiling, or a magnet losing its
            magnetic field when it's heated.
            </p>
            <p>
            In
            particular, I study various mathematical models of
            statistical mechanical systems, and exploit the fundamental
            property of <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition#Critical_exponents_and_universality_classes">universality</a>.
            Universality guarantees that no matter how simple or
            idealised a model is, provided it is in the same
            &ldquo;universality class&rdquo; the model will have
            <em>exactly</em> the same fundamental properties as real,
            physical systems. One example of universality, and in fact
            the one I'm most familiar with, is the way self-avoiding
            walks exactly model certain aspects of polymers (long
            molecules) in a solvent.
            </p>
            <p>
            For my PhD I worked with Barry McCoy at Stony Brook and made
            some improvements in the numerical and analytical
            calculation of virial coefficients for hard spheres. Hard
            spheres are an excellent model of colloids and are
            historically important for a host of reasons, including the
            fact that when compressed the hard sphere system change state
            from a fluid to a solid. However, much
            remains to be done in this direction!
            </p>
            <p>
            More recently my primary research focus has been to build upon the intuition
            I have gained into the efficient Monte Carlo simulation of self-avoiding
            walks via the pivot algorithm to a wide variety of other
            problems, both in the field of statistical mechanics and
            more broadly. I believe that significant progress
            is possible
            for a wide range of applications where Markov chain Monte Carlo is the state
            of the art.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm interested in many other topics (it may be shorter to
            list things I find uninteresting!), but in particular I have
            research interests in developing efficient enumeration
            algorithms, physical combinatorics, climate change (in
            particular policy around methane and carbon dioxide,
            so-called multi-gas modelling), modelling more broadly,
            polymer physics, and mathematical visualisation.
