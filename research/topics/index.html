        topics below. No citations are given for the moment - sorry! -
        as I've only got time to write down some broad brushstrokes.
        I&rsquo;ve highlighted a few potential projects,
        but there are many more possibilities.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>
In 2010 I developed a new implementation of the pivot algorithm for
self-avoiding walks which used a binary tree representation called a
SAW-tree, building on
earlier work of Tom Kennedy, Neal Madras and Alan Sokal. This radically
efficient implementation allows for global changes to be made to the
system in logarithmic time, and so opens up the possibility of studying
truly large polymer systems with millions or even billions of monomers.

            </p>
            <p>
The underlying principle can be applied to any system for which simple
sampling is the state of the art.
I am pursuing applications to percolation models and quantitative
finance, but there must be many more possibilities.

            <h2 id="virial">
                Virial series for hard spheres and related models
            </h2>
            <p>
The virial expansion is an old technique for understanding the low
density behaviour of classical and quantum systems, which comes down to
the evaluation of certain integrals that can be represented graphically.
For the hard sphere model, also known as the billiard ball model of the
gas, this leads to interesting research questions around the evaluation
of graph polynomials, geometry of packings/sphere overlaps, high
performance computing, and series analysis. The resulting series are
interesting in and of themselves, but the key question is: can
coefficients of the virial series be evaluated to sufficiently high
order, and high accuracy, so that the series can tell us something about
the fluid-solid phase transition?
            </p>
            <p>

The answer is completely unclear! However, it is possible to make a
great stride forward in this area by performing a high powered computer
experiment in combination with advanced algorithms.

            </p>
            <p>
Other related problems which are interesting, and possibly more
tractable than hard spheres, are lattice hard cubes (amenable to lattice
enumeration methods) and parallel hard
squares and cubes (for which the integrals become rational numbers).

            </p>
            <p>
There are lots of fun, open problems in this area.

            <h2 id="enumeration">
                Enumeration of self-avoiding walks and related objects
            </h2>
            <p>
Lattice enumeration is a powerful method for the study of lattice models
in statistical mechanics. 
I recently developed, in collaboration with Iwan Jensen, an improved
variant of the finite lattice method for
enumeration of self-avoiding walks and polygons, which opens up the
study of these models in three-dimensions. The improved method can also
be applied to various 2d models, but there the relative gain is more
modest.

            </p>
            <p>
The length-doubling algorithm developed by Schram, Barkema and Bisseling
is another fascinating recent development in the enumeration of 3d
self-avoiding walks.

            </p>
            <h2 id="endless">
                Endless walk models
            </h2>
            <p>
            Recently, I introduced a variant of self-avoiding walks with
            no ends, which are roughly equivalent to necklaces in the
            field of combinatorics.
            </p>
            <p>

            This simple idea can be applied to any walk model, and so
            opens up a whole host of fun problems, e.g. the derivation
            of exact results for endless variants of partially directed
            walks.

            <h2 id="climate">
                Multi-gas modelling for better policy decisions
                regarding climate change
            </h2>
            <p>
Over the course of the coming century it is absolutely essential that
humanity completely eliminate its dependence on fossil fuels, as
long-lived greenhouse gases would otherwise cause sufficient amounts of
warming and climate change that civilisation as we know could no longer
function.
            </p>
            <p>

There is much science still to be done in this field, but equally
important are questions of economics, so that the transition to a
low-carbon economy can occur along the pathway of least cost. One key
issue here is the trade-off between mitigating the most significant
anthropogenic greenhouse gases, namely carbon dioxide and methane. Often
you&rsquo;ll see it stated that methane is 20 or 100 times as potent as
carbon dioxide, but such statements usually gloss over a key point: the
relative importance, as measured by the Global Warming Potential (GWP)
metric, is determined by the time frame considered. Methane is
relatively short-lived in the atmosphere, of the order of a decade,
while atmospheric carbon dioxide has a number of different time scales,
but a key point is that of the order of 5-10% of the carbon dioxide
emitted now will remain in the atmosphere for centuries or even
millenia.
            </p>
            <p>

A key consequence of this, which is not widely understood, is that net
emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels must go to zero, while
methane emissions from anthropogenic but non-fossil fuel sources (think
emissions from ruminants in agriculture, i.e. farting cows) can continue
forever. (They make a steady-state contribution to the increase in
radiative forcing which results in global warming.)

            </p>
            <p>
There is an important space here for rigorous economic modelling
combined with scientific understanding of the underlying processes. It
is possible to approximately decouple the economics from the mix of
greenhouse gases by introducing notions of equivalence which do a (much)
better job than GWP on a wide variety of timescales, from a decade or
two to multi-century.

            <h2 id="polymer">
                Polymer physics
            </h2>
            <p>
Monte Carlo algorithms which utilise so-called connectivity
changing moves may be very effective for simulation of dense polymer
systems, such as confined / crystallised polymers which can be represented by
Hamiltonian paths, or polymer melts.

            </p>
            <p>
These moves can be performed extremely efficiently by using data
structures like the SAW-tree.

            </p>
            <p>

It may also be possible to extend variants of the efficient Monte Carlo
algorithms for self-avoiding walks (i.e. similar to the pivot move)
to other polymer systems, such as
confined polymers and the polymer theta transition (the collapse transition for polymers
as they go from a good solvent to a poor solvent), and semi-dilute
polymer systems.

            </p>
            <p>
It is also possible to efficiently calculate virial coefficients for
polymers (the second virial coefficient corresponds to the so-called
interpenetration ratio) via a combination of the SAW-tree data structure
and scale-free moves which allow for a radically effective form of
importance sampling.

            </p>



            <h2 id="visualisation">
                Mathematical visualisation
            </h2>
            <p>
Simulations and visualisations can be fantastic tools for both research,
and for education, as they allow us to gain intuition into mathematical
objects which is very hard to arrive at through pure thought (for me at
least!).
            </p>
            <p>

Visualisations can be made in Processing and javascript (of course many
other tools exist, but these are powerful, and work well with the web
which is where you want to be).

            </p>
            <p>
Videos, especially in 3D, may be very powerful for mathematical objects.

            </p>
            <p>
Other fun tools which will allow for completely new experiences in the
future are virtual reality, and 3d printing to create tangible
realisations of mathematical objects.

            </p>
            <p>
I have a number of ideas for mathematically inspired games which arise
out of algorithms for walks.

<h2 id="gpu">
    Backtracking algorithms implemented on GPUs
</h2>
            <p>

GPUs are extremely powerful for some applications - namely those which
are easily parallelisable, especially so-called embarrassingly parallel
applications - but are not a general purpose replacement for CPUs.
            </p>
            <p>

One class of problems for which it is not obvious that efficient
algorithms exist, are backtracking problems which are ubiquitous in
combinatorial search and graph algorithms. These can in fact be cast in
a form that is appropriate for GPUs, and this leads to a fun and
challenging field of problems in algorithms in computer science,
especially given that the technology is changing so quickly.
