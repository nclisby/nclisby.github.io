            Hey Greg,
                </p> <p>

            Just thought I'd mention something on the off chance we can
            actually do this sometime. I'm very likely going to take
            Maia to the Mt Shadwell quarry near Mortlake on Friday
            (details below, in an email to parents of a friend of
            Maia's), driving out early on Friday morning and just
            returning to Melbourne in the evening. I was half thinking
            that you could meet us there, if you think you and your
            daughters might like it.
                </p> <p>

            Mortlake is about 2.5 hours drive from Melbourne, and a
            little over 3 hours drive from Millicent.
                </p> <p>

            Unfortunately it seems that school holidays haven't yet
            started in SA, so probably not an option for you after all.
            But if it turns out well for me and Maia then hopefully
            we'll do it again sometime.
                </p> <p>

            Hope you and your family are well. I'll write again soon-ish
            (still haven't responded to your last emails, sorry!), and
            will catch up again for a beer over the phone one of these
            days.
                </p> <p>

            Cheers,
                </p> <p>

            Nathan

            Hi Sophia and Keith,

                </p> <p>
            I'm just going to write briefly about some ideas for
            gemstone and mineral fossicking, which we might be able to
            do with the kids sometime.
                </p> <p>

            I know Laney's really keen on this (she's mentioned it a
            couple of times, e.g. when I was in science class the week
            before last), and I know Maia is too, so it would be great
            if we could find a joint activity sometime.
                </p> <p>

            I've been reading up and collecting resources on places to
            fossick near Melbourne, and unfortunately there is not
            terribly much - or at least there are no easy places to find
            large gemstones nearby.
                </p> <p>

            The best places seem to be various creeks in state parks and
            forests where fossicking for gemstones is allowed. In
            particular, Maia and I went up to a creek near Daylesford
            about a month and a half ago to fossick for zircons. This
            didn't turn out very well! Maia had alarmingly little
            patience, and it was quite cold, and in the end we found
            about 20 specks of colour varying in size from microscopic
            to very small. My understanding is that you can get
            occasional gem quality zircons from this area, and if we had
            had a little bit more patience (only spent 30 minutes there)
            and tried a different spot or two we would likely have fared
            a bit better.
                </p> <p>

            I didn't tell you about this at the time because I was not
            at all confident we'd find anything at all - I wanted to
            give it a try once, and then organise a joint trip the next
            time around.
                </p> <p>

            So, Daylesford is an option for a joint trip, provided you
            have low expectations! Maybe sometime in week 2 of the
            school holidays, or possibly as soon as next weekend, if
            you're up for it.
                </p> <p>

            Another option, and one I'm seriously considering doing with
            Maia this week, is to visit the Mt Shadwell quarry near
            Mortlake, which is about 2.5 hours drive from Melbourne.
            There they have plentiful olivine scoria "bombs" which you
            can crack open with a hammer to find crystals, and in rare
            cases peridot gemstones. The quarry is open for fossicking
            on Fridays only, so I'm thinking of going this coming
            Friday, 25/9 as we will be away on the following week. Laney
            suggested that you'd be away or busy during week 1, so this
            might not be an option for you.
                </p> <p>

            I'm considering whether to head to Colac the night before
            and staying in a motel, or just going directly to Mortlake
            and back on the same day.
                </p> <p>

            I have to admit, I'm nervous that Maia will decide it's too
            much hard work and not engage with it. So, it could either
            be lots of fun or a complete disaster of a trip.
                </p> <p>

            To see what sort of minerals can be found have a look at:
            https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremypike/sets/72157650783884118
            , especially down the bottom of the page.
                </p> <p>

            To crack open the scoria you will need a hammer - I have a
            so-called "crack hammer" for cracking open rocks - but a
            sledge hammer would work and might even be better, sturdy
            shoes, and working gloves for handling the rocks.
                </p> <p>

            The Mortland shire page is:
            http://www.moyne.vic.gov.au/Our-Services/Mount-Shadwell-Quarry
            It's necessary to fill in an indemnity form which can be
            sent to the council via email, and I have confirmed that the
            quarry is open for fossicking this coming Friday.
                </p> <p>

            OK, I'll leave it there for now. Please let me know if
            you're keen on a trip to Mt Shadwell quarry or Daylesford
            anytime soon.
                </p> <p>

            Cheers,
                </p> <p>

            Nathan
                </p> <p>

            p.s.: I've found out about a few other places: there are
            creeks for fossicking in the Dandenongs, and some in state
            forests to the north west, and supposedly Beechworth is
            excellent for fossicking, and a lake in the Gippsland area.
