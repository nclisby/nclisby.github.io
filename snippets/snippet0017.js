document.write(' <div class="quote">The argument is simple. Suppose that the human population is always increasing, let&rquo;s say exponentially, and will one day fall to zero through some catastrophe. Then most humans of those ever born will live within a few generations of the end of the world. If I think of myself as a &lquo;random&rquo; human being, drawn from the number of all who ever have lived or ever will live, then it is most likely that I am one of those living close to the end of the world. Therefore, the end of the world will probably occur soon. This could be good news for those of us hoping to avoid the next research assessment exercise.</div> Rose D Baker in Probability Paradoxes, Mathematics Today (2002).');
