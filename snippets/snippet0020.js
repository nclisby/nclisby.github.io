document.write(' <div class="quote">The interesting thing about that is, Keeling’s a peculiar guy. He wants to measure CO2 in his belly. He really never wanted to do anything else but measure CO2.  And he wants to measure it with the greatest precision and the greatest accuracy he possibly can, and he’s done that. He’s measured it more or less consistently to a tenth of a part per million, and continuously for 30 years. It’s really quite a remarkable record.</div> Roger Revelle on Charles Keeling and the Keeling curve, in <a href="https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/5051">Interview by Earl Droessler</a>.');
