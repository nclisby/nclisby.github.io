document.write(' <div class="quote">The interesting thing about that is, Keeling&rsquo;s a peculiar guy. He wants to measure CO<sub>2</sub> in his belly. He really never wanted to do anything else but measure CO<sub>2</sub>. And he wants to measure it with the greatest precision and the greatest accuracy he possibly can, and he&rsquo;s done that. He&rsquo;s measured it more or less consistently to a tenth of a part per million, and continuously for 30 years. It&rsquo;s really quite a remarkable record.</div> Roger Revelle on Charles Keeling and the Keeling curve, in <a href="https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/5051">Interview by Earl Droessler</a>.');
