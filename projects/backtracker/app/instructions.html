        <h1>Instructions for Backtracker</h1>
        <p>
        The goal of this game is to try to find
        special objects by navigating
        through a tree
        "maze".
        </p>
        <p>
        To play this game, you must first load a file from the menu on
        the right-hand side of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can then generate the tree by clicking on "leaf nodes",
        which are the discs at the bottom of the tree.
        </p>
        <p>
        Orange discs <em>may</em> lead to a solution, red discs
        <em>cannot</em> lead to a solution, while green discs at the
        bottom of the tree are the objects we are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is up to you to develop strategies to find the green nodes!
        We present some information about the objects being generated by
        giving the nodes different sizes, but the structure of the tree
        may give you other hints.
        </p>
        <p>
        Start with small cases, trying to develop strategies before
        moving on to the harder large cases. If you are the first person
        to solve a particular case your name will be added to the honour
        roll!
        </p>

        <h1>Controls</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking on a leaf node will start the search program,
            which will explore a new part of the tree.</li>
            <li>Clicking on the root node will move the whole tree down
            by one level.</li>
            <li>Clicking on an internal node will move that node to the
            root.</li>
            <li>Zoom in and out of the tree with + and - buttons.</li>
            <li>Change the search depth by selecting the appropriate
            value in the menu.</li>
            <li>Toggle between search mode and inspect mode. In search
            mode you can generate and explore the backtracking tree,
            while in inspect mode you can see what objects are being
            represented by nodes in the tree.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Foldit, combinatorial search - hard problem, humans although
        far slower than computers may be able to develop good heuristics
        to solve genuinely hard problems. When there are
        10<sup>100</sup> nodes in a tree, brains are more important than
        brawn.
        </p>
        <p>
        Decomposition of Gram matrices - hard problem. Hadamard
        conjecture.
        </p>
        <p>
        Backtracker - general paradigm for combinatorial search. This is
        just first application.
