            Inspired by an idea from <a
                href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/judy-anne-osborn">Judy-anne
                Osborn</a>, I've been working with

                Brent</a>,
            <a href="http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~leopardi/">Paul

            and <a
                href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/nathan-vanmaastricht">Nathan
                Van Maastricht</a> (as well as Judy-anne)
            to create a web application for human-guided computer search
            in combinatorial search problems. The idea is to present a
            visual representation of the backtracking search tree,
            together with some information about candidate choices, and
            then allow the human to guide the computer search through
            their own heuristics (intuition).

            <b>A prototype version can be played <a href="app/"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.</b>
            (The app will open in a new window.) N.B., in future the app will
            very likely move to a different url.
            </p>
            <p>
            This prototype works for the 
            decomposition of a putative Gram matrix with the goal of
            finding maximal determinant matrices (the original
            inspiration), and two toy problems: open 
            <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">knight's
                tours</a> on
            arbitrary boards, and the <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">N
                queens</a> problem.
            </p>
            <p>
            What's the largest board for which you can find an open
            knight's tour? (Hints: <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Warnsdorff.27s_rule">Warnsdorff's
                rule</a> is an effective heuristic, and mind the corners
            of the board.)
            </p>
            <p>
            There is much still to do! The remaining stages will involve
            elements of game design, javascript programming, server side
            scripting, and research into the specific applications. We
            want the app to be both more attractive and
            &ldquo;playable&rdquo;, as well as useful for research
            through clever design of the computer search algorithm and
            use of parallel threads carrying out searches in the
            background.
            </p>
            <p>
            The computer search runs client side, leveraging the great
            leaps in efficiency of javascript interpreters in recent
            years.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note that it is only suitable for playing on a computer for
            the moment, i.e. it is not at all mobile friendly. This is because
            different kinds of mouse clicks are required to interact
            with the backtracking tree.
            </p>
            <h3>Brief instructions</h3>
            <p>
            Your goal is to search for a solution to the combinatorial
            search problem, e.g. a valid matrix decomposition, or a
            knight's tour, or a complete N queens configuration. These
            solutions are represented in the backtracking tree by dark
            green nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
            First you must access the left-most menu to choose which
            application to use (Gram matrix decomposition, knight's
            tour, N queens), then choose the problem case for the
            application (e.g. board dimension for knight's tour).
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, press the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button to start the app.
            </p>
            <p>
            The remaining menu specifies the &ldquo;search depth&rdquo;. A
            good default option is three, but one needs to be careful
            that this depth is not too great. If the branching ratio of
            the backtracking tree is too large then the search will not
            terminate in a reasonable time frame, and likely the memory
            allocated to the browser will be exhausted causing your web
            browser to crash. This is not a problem for the knight's
            tour and N queens applications where the branching ratio is
            bounded, but is a significant issue for the Gram matrix
            decomposition, especially the larger cases.
            </p>
            <p>
            Solutions are dark green, while dead ends are
            red. These are, by necessity, leaves of the
            backtracking tree. Internal nodes may have one of three
            possible states, uncertain (amber), leads to solution (light
            green), and leads to only dead ends (pink).
            </p>
            <p>
            To interact with the search tree you have three basic
            operations.
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Inspect:</th>
                    <td>Show the combinatorial object
                        corresponding to a particular node in the
                        tree.</td>
                    <td>Left click on the node.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Search:</th>
                    <td>Search the backtracking tree starting from a
                        particular node.
                    </td>
                    <td>Alt-click, Command-click / Windows
                        key-click.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Shift:</th>
                    <td>
                        Change the focus of the part of the tree that is
                        shown. If you click on the root it will move the
                        tree down one level, otherwise clicking on any
                        other node will bring it to the root.
                    </td>
                    <td>Shift-click.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            There are 3 additional graphical buttons in the tree canvas
            area. The &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; keys zoom in
            and out respectively, while the up arrow jumps up to the
            root of the whole tree instantaneously (useful when you have
            dived deep into a tree and want to start over).
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, a limited amount of feedback is provided above the
            tree, keeping track of the number of search operations
            (moves), nodes searched, and solutions found.
            </p>
            <p>
            Have fun! Any feedback would be gratefully received.
