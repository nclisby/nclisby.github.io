<b>About:</b> This javascript program generates a Hamiltonian path on an n &times; n grid
using the backbite move described in the paper &ldquo;Secondary structures
in long compact polymers&rdquo; by Richard Oberdorf, Allison Ferguson, Jesper
L. Jacobsen and Jan&eacute; Kondev, Phys. Rev. E 74, 051801 (2006).
Paper available via the <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.051801">APS</a>
(subscription required) or as a pre-print on the <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0508094">arXiv</a>. The resulting
path is displayed below both as an image and as a sequence of grid
points. (Further <a href="#details">technical details</a> at the bottom of the page.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Initialisation:</b> Specify desired grid size and choose &ldquo;quality factor&rdquo; which
determines how &ldquo;random&rdquo; the path will be (QF=1 is a good
default choice), then click &ldquo;Generate
Hamiltonian path&rdquo;. Check &ldquo;Circuits only&rdquo; if you wish to
only generate Hamiltonian circuits. The default option is for the starting configuration to visit
every site, but if you unselect &ldquo;Must fill&rdquo; it's possible that not every site will be
visited. In particular, if you set quality factor to 0, and unselect &ldquo;Must fill&rdquo; then
the starting configuration will be a single point starting at a randomly selected site.
</p>
<p>
<b>Play game:</b>
Toggle the active end by
pressing &ldquo;t&rdquo;, toggle the display of arrows indicating the
path direction by pressing &ldquo;a&rdquo;, and make backbite moves by moving the active end using the
direction keys. Can you make a spiral, starting from a random
configuration? 
</p>
<p>
<b>See effect of random backbite moves, enter either via keyboard or
    clicking appropriate button:</b> &ldquo;r&rdquo; makes a random move for the active end (hold down to
repeat), &ldquo;shift+r&rdquo; makes 100 random moves, &ldquo;e&rdquo; makes a
random move for either end (hold down to repeat), &ldquo;shift+e&rdquo; makes 100
random moves.
</p>
<p>
New command (June 4, 2015): &ldquo;s&rdquo; toggles between different
modes for showing the trace of the movement of the ends. Default mode: show
nothing, record nothing (erase traces). Record mode: record traces and
draw them. Show mode: no longer add to recording of traces, but continue showing
existing one.
</p>
<p>
New command (February 1, 2016): &ldquo;v&rdquo; toggles between 
hiding and showing walk, in order to highly the vector field (arrows).

<b>History:</b> The impetus to create this generator came from <a
href="http://danielcrooks.com/">Daniel Crooks</a>, an artist based in Melbourne, who needed a
tool for generating long Hamiltonian paths.
In his words: 
<div class="blockquote">My original
interest in the Hamiltonian paths was for a portraiture project. I've
developed a process for taking large format photographs using a video
camera and a robotic pan/tilt head to 'scan' the image of the sitter
over time. As part of the research I became interested in Hamiltonian
paths, firstly as a motion path for the camera and then subsequently the
aesthetic and conceptual possibilities inherent in the paths
themselves.</div>
</p>
<p>
I had previously come
across the aforementioned paper on sampling Hamiltonian paths,
and took the
opportunity to learn some javascript and create this generator.
I hope to apply the expertise gained in this enterprise to other
visualisation projects in combinatorics and statistical mechanics.
</p>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b> Specify desired grid size and choose &ldquo;quality
factor&rdquo; which
determines how &ldquo;random&rdquo; the path will be, then click "Generate
Hamiltonian path" or reload page. Check &ldquo;Circuits only&rdquo; if you wish to
only generate Hamiltonian circuits (read <a href="#details">technical
details</a> below to see why circuits are not
selected uniformly at random).
</p>
<p>
Quality factor of 1.0 should be fine for most
purposes; for large grids it may be worth trying 0.5 or even
0.1.
</p>
<p>
Tested on firefox and chrome browsers. N.B.: for large grids (say 100
&times; 100 or larger) you may be prompted to stop the script due to the
long running time. For chrome, I found that if I did nothing the script
would keep running in the background, whereas for firefox I would have
to click "continue" for the script to complete.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="details">Technical details:</a></b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Running time(n &times; n grid) = (Quality factor) &times; 20 &times;
n<sup>2</sup>
log<sup>2</sup>n &times; Pr(success of backbite move)
&times; (Expected CPU time for backbite move)</li>
<li>The `quality factor' is an arbitrary constant, while the factor of 20
seems to ensure that Hamiltonian path with good randomness is achieved
when quality factor is 1.</li>
<li>The cover time for the simple random walk on an n
&times; n grid is n<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>n (I've found this stated
in a number of places, but if anyone could give me the original
reference I would appreciate it). The Hamiltonian path endpoints perform
something like a random walk on the grid, and so we use this as an
approximation for the cover time. (It may be a tight bound, but I'm not
an expert on this problem and can only say that it seems plausible that
the bound is in fact tight.)</li>
<li>The probability of success of the backbite
move approaches 1 as n becomes large.</li>
<li>I have not performed any testing
to determine the mean CPU time for a backbite move, but it must be
O(n<sup>2</sup>), and it is reasonable to suppose that in fact it is a relatively
small power of n. A more sophisticated implementation would allow the
backbite move to be performed in time O(log n).</li>
<li>The Markov chain resulting from repeated application of the
backbite move has not (yet) been
proved to be ergodic. This is an interesting open problem. The Markov
chain is ergodic
for small grid sizes, and my intuition is that
the algorithm is extremely likely to be ergodic
for arbitrary two-dimensional
grids (it seems to me that if the set of Hamiltonian paths were to be
       disconnected this would be more likely to occur for smaller grids
       for which the grid boundary has greater influence).
For three dimensions and
higher I don't have any intuition because here large grids are intrinsically
different to small grids due to the existence of knots.
</li>
<li>
Hamiltonian circuit generator just generates a path, and continues
iterating the backbite move until a circuit is generated. This method
<it>cannot</it> select a circuit uniformly at random because circuit
selection probability is weighted by the (expected) space between
samples. I think this can be best explained by an example: suppose we
have a Markov chain to uniformly select elements 1 and 2 from a list of
N elements. For each time step we can move up or down one element on the
list with uniform probability; if this reaches 0 or N+1 the move is
rejected. This Markov chain selects 1 and 2 with uniform probability,
    but if we look at the behaviour of the full chain the probability
    that we will sample 1 before 2 given an arbitrary starting time vanishes with
    increasing N as 1/N. This is because at the starting time we are
    almost surely in the interval [3,N], and in this case the next
    element must be a 2. This is
    an extreme example, and the Hamiltonian circuits generated here are
    likely to be statistically extremely similar to circuits generated
    from the uniform distribution, but the method used in this
    Hamiltonian circuit generator should most definitely not
    be used for serious numerical work.
