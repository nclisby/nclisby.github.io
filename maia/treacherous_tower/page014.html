    You know this must be the second to last part of this passage of the
    journey.
    </p>

    <p>
    You are suspecting this is the dining room. But then you notice a
    low-pitched growl. 
    </p>

    <p>
    You must face the final male of the giant reptile-dog, which has scales
    on its tail, but the rest of its body is furry and warm. The reptile-dog
    belongs to Nancy, so it is against you. But you smile; you realise
    that you do not have to make the last, final choice that the owner
    of treacherous tower recommended. You know that the first thing that
    every giant male reptile-dog is looking for is a mate, and the
    second thing is food. They are actually not carnivores, and their
    favourite food is cooked carrot. Luckily, you took a carrot
    with you for a snack on the bushwalk, and it cooked when you went down
    the boiling passage!
