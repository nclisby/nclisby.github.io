    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
You examine the tower carefully, trying to find an entrance. You try the
door handle and are surprised to find the door unlocked. It also makes
you a bit suspicious. Why would the door be unlocked - is it a trap?
There is also a swan statue, which if it were alive would be large
enough to carry you through a window that is open in the tower. That
would also be possible, even if it were only a statue, because there is
a bag of fairy dust which is supposed to bring statues to life in your
bag (even though you have not tried it yet).

<div class="choice">
    Do you choose to <a href="page004.html">bring the statue to life and ride the statue
        through the window</a>, or <a href="page005.html">open the front door and walk into the tower
        that way</a>.
