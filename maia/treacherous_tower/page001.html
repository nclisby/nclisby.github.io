    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
You are walking along happily on a bushwalk in a tropical
rainforest, which is eerily quiet. You glance around and
notice a tall and forbidding stone tower, which you estimate
is over 100 years old. Just one problem: you do this walk
every day, and it wasn't there yesterday! Perhaps you got
lost, but that couldn't be as you're extremely familiar with
this track.  Anyway, getting back to the tower, there is a
note lying on a bush beside it. The note is spookily frayed
and burnt on the edges, like a pirate's map you might see at
the movies. You read out:
<blockquote>
Dear friend,<br/><br/>

This is my dear tower, called Treacherous Tower. Someone has
broken in, and stolen the jewellery which was beside the
front door.  The police chased them away, but the jewellery
is still hidden somewhere inside Treacherous Tower. I'm
requesting that you find my jewellery, with only this to
help you: My most precious possession, a diamond necklace,
has been separated from the rest of the jewellery.<br/><br/>

From your friend, the owner of Treacherous Tower.<br/>

p.s.: We do not know if the burglars still have the diamond necklace or not.
</blockquote>
It does sound like an exciting adventure is in store, 
but at the same time you can't help but wonder about the
motives of the mysterious owner.

    Do you choose to <a href="page002.html">
        enter the tower</a>, or to <a href="page003.html">go
        home</a> because you either don't trust the owner, or think
    the tower looks too spooky and dangerous.
