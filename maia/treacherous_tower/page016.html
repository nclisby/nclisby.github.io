    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
    <p>
    You have found both the diamond necklace
    and the other jewellery! Jubilantly, you head back towards the main
    entrance, hoping to meet the mysterious owner.
    </p>
    <p>
    As you turn the corner you see that there is a huge party going on
    outside. Everyone says &ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; which doesn't
    make sense to you because you are alone. But then you notice Wispy
    the reptile-dog has followed you. Your friends tip Wispy on his back
    and unzip a strange zipper in his fur, revealing your dog, Blossom,
    inside! She gives you a giant lick!
    </p>
    <p>
    You ask &ldquo;What is this all about? I know it's my birthday but
    what about the tower? Who is the mysterious owner?&rdquo;
    Your mother hands you a letter which explains everything:
<blockquote>
    Dear friend,<br>
    <br/>

    The owners of Treacherous Tower are your mother and father. This tower has
    been hidden in the forest for hundreds of years. We moved the
    path, and built Flora the robot, who we designed to come to life
    when any crumbly powder is placed on her. Like your fairy dust,
    which was actually just plain sand. 
    <br/>
    <br/>

    This whole thing was set up to give you a memorable birthday, and we
    hope that you found all of the sweets and presents inside! We also
    made this birthday surprise because we have one big secret which we are about
    to reveal: this tower will be yours when you turn 18! And until then
    you can play in it as much as you like, but you can't redecorate it
    for the moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    From your Mum and Dad, the owners of Treacherous Tower.

</blockquote>

    <p>
    You say with a smile &ldquo;I wouldn't redecorate Treacherous Tower
    anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
