    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
You proceed down the right-hand icy path, and enter a room which you
suspect must have been a royal painter's room, because there are dried pots
of paint and paint-stained aprons all over the floor.  
</p>

<p>
For a second you think you must have chosen the wrong path, but then you
see that there is a riddle you have to solve, and a choice you must
make.
</p>

<p>
Written in chalk on an old slate, which was probably used for sketches
and studies by the painter, you read some gold, slanted writing:
<blockquote>
    Hello, this is a note from me, the burglar and my friend. My name is
    Nancy. You have done a good job to make it this far; you must have
    been to lucky to avoid my traps because surely they could not have
    failed. But this is an impossible riddle which you must solve; not
    once in a lifetime has this trap failed.
    <br/><br/>

    Here is the riddle: what starts with &lsquo;e&rsquo; and ends with
    &lsquo;e&rsquo;, but has one letter in it?
    <br/><br/>

    If you choose the wrong object you will be injured terribly.
</blockquote>
You look around and notice only two items which seem clearly out of
place: a packed envelope, and a piece of paper with
&lsquo;e&rsquo; written on it.
</p>

<br/>
<div class="choice">
    Will you pick up the <a href="page012.html">envelope</a> or the <a
        href="page013.html">piece of paper</a>?
