    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
As Flora is leaving, to your surprise you notice a small cable sticking out of her body.
You rub your eyes, and it's still there. She must have got stuck in a
wire fence, you think. She probably got electrocuted and turned into a
statue.
</p>
<p>
You look around the room, and see the entrances of two steep passages.
You see two boards leaning against the wall, one of them is a snowboard
and the other a surfboard. You notice a fancily written message
scratched onto the wall with a nail immediately above the boards. It is
written in a strange font which is hard to decipher, but you manage
eventually. This is what you read after you have deciphered the message:
<blockquote>
Dear friend,<br/><br/>

You must choose the surfboard and proceed down the left passage which is
a giant waterslide, or the snowboard to go down
the right passage which is covered in something that may seem like snow.
One of these passages will not allow you to finish your journey.
<br/><br/>


From your friend, the owner of Treacherous Tower.<br/>
