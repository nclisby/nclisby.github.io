    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
As you turn the handle a hook grabs hold of your vest from the back. It
is a motor-running pulley that pulls you off the ground and leaves you
stuck in the air. You fear that you may be stuck there forever. Lucky
for you the rope breaks before it lifts you too far from the ground, but
you still get a nasty bruise on your left arm.

<p>
Now that the trap has been cleared, you proceed through the front door.
