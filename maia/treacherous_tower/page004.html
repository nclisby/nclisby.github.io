    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
The reason you had the fairy dust and knew how to use it was
that it fell out of the sky into your bag, and you felt the difference
in weight in your bag and read the label. You had thought this was a
strange prank from your friends, but with the appearance of the
mysterious tower you are now wondering if the fairy dust might actually be real.
</p>

<p>
You take a pinch of fairy dust and sprinkle it over the swan statue. The
swan spreads its majestic wings, its body beating with life. And it
begins to speak!
<blockquote>
    Hi. I'm Flora. I thought I was going to be stuck as a statue
    forever, thank you so much for rescuing me. Since you seem to be not
    too heavy, I will give you one ride to any place you wish. Where
    would you like to go?
</blockquote>
You can't believe your luck! This swan is willing to take you
wherever you want to go. Of course you choose to go to the window that
would lead you into the tower.
</p>

<p>
As you clamber through the window you thank Flora and say goodbye.
