    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
As you run down the left passage, the climate begins to get warmer, and
suddenly it is warm enough to cook a carrot. You take a sip of water,
and you feel magically refreshed. The effect lasts until you have
reached a section of the passage where the temperature drops. 
</p>

<p>
As you reach the end of the passage you find a pool that looks more like
a lake nowadays in a grand old ballroom. You can picture Treacherous
Tower as a beautiful home for kings, queens, and princesses, but those
glory days have faded. Now, Treacherous Tower stands abandoned, with
only you and the mysterious owner for company.
</p>

<p>
But now the temperature is getting much, much colder than it was before,
in fact it is <b><font style="color:lightblue">FREEZING</font></b>.
</p>

<p>
You are guessing that the water in the jug is magic, as it is exploding the
jug as it freezes, and making two frozen paths in the pond. A note
flutters down from a hole in the roof, it says:
<blockquote>
    Dear friend,<br/><br/>

    I'm glad to see that you have made it this far. There are only three
    more choices that you have to make for this passage of your
    adventure.<br/><br/>

    There are two places that you can explore, except one of them you
    can't exactly explore because there is a trap at the end of it. You
    must choose one of the places that you want to go to, but you will
    not be harmed if you go to the room with a trap, because the
    burglars have not spent much time working on their traps so I am 99%
    sure that the trap will break.<br/><br/>

    From your friend, the owner of Treacherous Tower.
    <br/>
    P.s.: We are guessing that the end of this passage of your
    adventure will lead you to
    my box of jewellery.
</blockquote>
