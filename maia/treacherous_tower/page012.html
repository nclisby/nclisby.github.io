You pick up the envelope and nothing suspicious happens. You open the
envelope and immediately start reading out the <em>letter</em> to
yourself:
<blockquote>
    Dear friend,<br/><br/>

    Nancy was not much of a skilled burglar, although she did find a
    good hiding place for my jewellery! <br/> <br/>

    You must run up the path behind the table. <br/> <br/>

    From your friend, the owner of Treacherous Tower. <br/>
    P.s.: The only reason why Nancy's riddle trap had never failed
    was because she had never actually tried it before!
</blockquote>
