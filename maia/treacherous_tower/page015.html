    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
    <p>
    As you throw the carrot to the reptile-dog, he gobbles it down
    quickly and then sits by your side with his neck up (probably waiting
    for his next command), and you are surprised to find a collar with a
    flattened copper coin that has the name &ldquo;Wispy&rdquo; on it.
    </p>
    <p>
    You scratch him under the chin, and he jumps around, barking; pretty
    lively for his age. Then you notice, slowly, slowly, with his
    bouncing and his barks, he starts circling around a chest. The
    mysterious owner's jewellery chest!
    </p>
    <p>
    Now you have found the jewellery chest, and you open it quickly,
    anxious to find out what is inside. 
    It is full of jewellery, which must belong to the mysterious owner.
    You notice a list of jewellery pinned to the outside of the chest,
    the list reads:
<blockquote>
    A set of gold bangles with ruby insets, with silver chains dangling
    from them,<br/>
    A set of emerald studded earrings,<br/>
    A sapphire ring,<br/>
    A brand new bracelet made from plaited horse-hair,<br/>
    A diamond necklace.
</blockquote>
    You check the jewellery in the chest against the list from the
    mysterious owner. First quickly, and then more slowly the second
    time around.
    All of it is there, except for the diamond necklace which
    is missing.
