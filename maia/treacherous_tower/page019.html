    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
You have always wanted to try snowboarding, which you have frequently
mentioned to your friends.
</p>

<p>
You grab the board and head down the right passage. The snow seems quite
crumbly and unlike snow, although it does it look a lot like snow. You
reach down and touch some of the mysterious substance, and find that in
fact the floor is covered in sugar!  Just as you start building up some
speed, your board gets hooked on something and you come to a sudden
halt. You're not worried because you find that you can unhook the
snowboard whenever you like.
</p>

<p> You dig down into the sugar and find a toffee apple and a wrapped
birthday present which has &ldquo;Birthday Surprise!&rdquo; written on
an attached card. You open the present and it is a box of kinetic sand,
which you have been wanting since your cousin got some on his last
birthday.  Ever since you played with the white kinetic sand with your
cousin you have wanted some of your own.  It is even your favourite
colour!  </p>

<p>
Now, every time that your board gets stuck, you dig around in the sugar
and find a sweet and a present! As you unwrap the final present, which
you'll hear about later, you unhook your board and go speeding down the
passage until you pop out of a hole at the end of the tube.
</p>

<p>
You go out with:
<ul>
    <li>
    A toffee apple and kinetic sand.
    </li>
    <li>
    Fairy floss and a toy plane.
    </li>
    <li>
    A giant rainbow lollipop and a spinning top.
    </li>
    <li>
    A mint chocolate bar and a craft set.
    </li>
    <li>
    A box of licorice all-sorts and the Jungle Book (the actual book,
    not the movie).
    </li>
</ul>
