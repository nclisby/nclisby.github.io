    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
After proceeding down the left icy path, you enter a resplendent throne room. You are
strongly confident that you made the right choice, because you can see
the burglars' footprints. But did they just come here to lay a trap?
</p>
<p>
You step on some unusually high ground. There is a weight coming down
towards the ground
nearby, and you realise that you are standing on a lever. You are so
shocked that you cannot react in time. Lucky for you the board falls of
its fulcrum and you are saved. You run back down the icy pathway and
this time take the right-hand path.
