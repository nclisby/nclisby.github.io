    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
You walk into a room which appears to be an old-fashioned study, with
bookshelves lining the walls, and a grand wooden desk that has a
large brass lamp, and something glinting in the middle.
</p>

<p>
As you pick up the glinting object, you cannot believe your luck - it is
the diamond necklace! After all of your previous struggles, you
can't believe it was so easy! Or, was this too easy? You decide to test
if the stones are really diamonds by scratching on the wall. 
It leaves no mark on the stone wall which means it cannot be diamond,
since diamond is the hardest known substance.
</p>

<p>
The fake diamond necklace slips out of your hands and falls onto the
stone floor, shattering into a million pieces. Glass. There is a
note hidden amongst the shards. The note reads:
<blockquote>
    Dear friend,<br>
    <br/>

    You have reached the end of this chapter of your adventure. There
    are two different animals carved onto the wall: a fish, and a cat.
    Choose the prey animal to solve the first riddle.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    From your friend, the owner of Treacherous Tower.
