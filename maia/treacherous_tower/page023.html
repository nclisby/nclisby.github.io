You push the fish stone marked with a 3, and you hear &ldquo;Dun, dun,
dun&rdquo;, the lights flicker out one by one, and you DIE!!!! Just
kidding! There really is music, and the lights do flicker, but you can
just choose 16 instead. Or, you can pretend you died and start again if
you really want to!
</p>

<br/>
<div class="choice">
    Do you choose <a href="page024.html">16</a>, or choose
        to pretend you have died and <a href="page001.html">start again</a>?
