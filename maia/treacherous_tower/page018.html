    <h1>Treacherous Tower</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>
You have always wanted to try surfing, and you finally have your chance!
It's funny how you were talking to your friends about this just a few
days ago. That must just be a coincidence, surely? They couldn't have
set this whole thing up, or could they? Dismissing this crazy thought,
you shake your head, grab the board and jump onto it at the top of the
left passage.
</p>
<p>
You build up some speed, and think to yourself &ldquo;This is so much
fun! This passage could not be possibly be the one with a dead
end.&rdquo; Unfortunately, that is exactly what you see as you go around
the next corner! You hold on for dear life, and then almost as if it was
set up just for this purpose, the surfboard fin catches a pipe hidden
below the surface of the water, so preventing you from having a nasty
collision with a brick wall.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, you clamber back up to the
top of the passage following a ladder on the side.
</p>
<p>
You are starting to feel that
this adventure may have something to do with your friends, although your
friends couldn't have known that you did this walk every day.  Unless
.... your parents had told them. But could they all be involved in this?
